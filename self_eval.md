# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
*I feel fairly confident with using built-in Ruby methods. The link provided in the methods_variables
lesson helps a lot; seeing the methods, definition, and examples all together*

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
*I felt pretty good writing methods for the first 3 final_practice questions. Question 4
me a little while to figure out how to type out my arguments, parameters, and puts statement correctly*

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
*I still don't quite understand the purpose of a parameter, unless I am overthinking things and it
is truly just a placeholder?*
*With this final_practice, we did methods with individual strings. I am wondering what it would look
like should we be doing methods with an Array of strings?*
